# GroupProject21-22
CTM Procedural Programing 2021/22

This repository was created for sharing the code of the group project.
## Check
If you made it here and them try to make a first commit to the [Check File]() with your name so we can check if everyone made it here. And that there is no problem with making a commit. 


## Ideas
If you have any ideas for the project, please head to the [Ideas Folder](https://github.com/CTM-Procedural-Programing/GroupProject21-22/blob/main/IDEAS.txt) and create a commit with your idea or add on.

Also under every Idea create a Voting section. Where people can vote for the idea and for example:
 ```

    Idea No.x
    Blah Blah Idea Idea

    Votes:
    Filip Zbo≈ôil
    Random guy named John who lives down the street
    etc...
    
```

## To do list and who does what you what
After we decicde on the main idea we can create a to do list and from there we can just mark who is doing what.
I would recommend using [trello](trello.com).
I have already created a board on there [Here](https://trello.com/invite/b/Njh5bFA0/642315ef91bbe61f2d992de270b1014d/group-project-2021-22) is the link.
